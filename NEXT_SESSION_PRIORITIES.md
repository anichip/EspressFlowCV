# Next Session Priorities - EspressFlowCV

## 🎯 High Priority Issues to Address

### 1. **ML Model Accuracy Improvements**
- Current: 91.5% test ROC-AUC but may need real-world validation
- Need to collect more diverse training data (different lighting, angles, cup types)
- Consider retraining with more "under" examples vs "good" shots
- Fine-tune threshold and feature engineering

### 2. **Camera Issues**
- **Problem**: Camera doesn't load initially even after granting permission
- **Behavior**: Requires app restart or permission re-grant to work
- **Location**: RecordingView.swift camera initialization
- **Fix needed**: Proper camera permission handling and initialization flow

### 3. **Missing Instant Feedback**
- **Problem**: Result popup doesn't appear after analysis completes
- **Current workaround**: Users must check History tab to see results
- **Location**: RecordingView.swift - `showingResult` sheet not triggering
- **API works perfectly**: Analysis completes and returns to iOS app successfully

### 4. **Testing Setup**
- ✅ **Working**: USB cable connection allows testing on iPhone
- ✅ **Working**: API server and ML model functional
- ✅ **Working**: History tab displays completed analyses

## 🔧 Current Status

### ✅ **Working Components:**
- ML pipeline (video → features → classification)
- Flask API server with trained Random Forest model
- Database storage and retrieval
- iOS app history display
- USB debugging and testing

### ❌ **Broken Components:**
- Camera permission initialization
- Real-time result popup display
- Potentially ML accuracy for real-world conditions

## 📋 Next Session Action Plan

1. **Fix camera initialization bug** in RecordingView.swift
2. **Debug result sheet display** issue (showingResult not triggering)
3. **Collect more training data** for model improvement
4. **Test real-world accuracy** with various espresso setups
5. **Consider model retraining** if accuracy issues persist

## 💾 **Current System State:**
- API Server: Shut down (restart with `python api_server.py`)
- Model Files: Saved (`espresso_model.joblib`, `model_metadata.joblib`)
- Database: Intact with test shots (`espresso_shots.db`)
- iOS App: Latest code compiled and working via USB
