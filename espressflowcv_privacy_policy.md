# Privacy Policy for EspressFlowCV

*Last updated: September 16, 2025*

## Overview

This privacy policy explains how our espresso shot analysis app collects, uses, and protects your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy through a privacy-by-design architecture where **your data stays on your device**.

## Information We Collect

### Video Data (Processed Only, Never Stored)
- **Espresso shot videos** that you choose to record and analyze are sent to our servers for **temporary processing only**
- **Video frames** are extracted and analyzed by our machine learning model on our servers
- **Videos are immediately deleted** after analysis - we retain no copies
- **Analysis results** (classification and confidence scores) are returned to your device

### Local Device Data (Your Control)
- **Shot history and statistics** are stored locally on your iPhone using iOS UserDefaults
- **App preferences and settings** remain on your device
- **All historical data** stays private on your device - we cannot access it

### No Personal Information
- **No account creation** or login required
- **No personal identification** collected
- **No user tracking** or profiling
- **No advertising data** collection

## How We Use Your Information

### Video Analysis Process
1. You record an espresso shot video on your iPhone
2. Video is temporarily uploaded to our Railway server for analysis
3. Our Random Forest machine learning model analyzes extraction quality
4. Classification result (good/under-extracted) and confidence score are returned
5. **Video is immediately deleted from our servers**
6. Results are stored locally on your device only

### No Secondary Use
- We do **not** use your videos for any purpose other than immediate analysis
- We do **not** train our models on user-submitted videos
- We do **not** store videos for future analysis or research

## Data Storage and Security

### On Your Device (Your Control)
- **Complete shot history** stored locally on your iPhone
- **Statistics and pie charts** calculated from your local data
- **Full user control** - delete individual shots or clear all data anytime
- **No cloud backup** unless you choose to enable iCloud for the app
- **Uninstalling the app** removes all data completely

### On Our Servers (Temporary Only)
- **No permanent storage** of any user videos or data
- **Immediate deletion** after analysis (typically within seconds)
- **Stateless service** - our server retains no memory of previous analyses
- **No user profiles** or accounts maintained

### Security Measures
- **HTTPS encryption** for all data transmission
- **Secure Railway cloud infrastructure** for video processing
- **No data retention** policies needed since we store nothing permanently
- **Isolated processing** - each video analysis is independent

## Data Sharing

We do **not**:
- Store your espresso shot videos permanently
- Share your videos with any third parties
- Sell any data to advertisers or other companies
- Create user profiles or accounts
- Track users across sessions or devices
- Require any personal information

## Your Control Over Data

### Complete Local Control
- **View all your shot history** in the app
- **Delete individual shots** anytime through the app interface
- **Clear all data** by deleting and reinstalling the app
- **Export your data** (if desired) through iOS sharing features
- **No server-side data** to request deletion of

### Server Processing
- **Automatic deletion** of videos after processing
- **No user data** stored on servers to access or delete
- **Temporary processing only** - typically under 30 seconds

## Technical Architecture

Our privacy-focused design ensures:
- **Stateless server** - provides analysis service only
- **Local-first data** - all user data stays on device
- **Zero data retention** - nothing permanently stored on servers
- **Privacy by design** - impossible for us to access user history

## Children's Privacy

This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we collect no personal information from any users, this policy applies equally to all age groups.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Since our architecture stores no user data, most changes would be to clarify our practices rather than change data handling. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
